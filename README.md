# bernibra.github.io

I made this [website](https://www.bernatbramon.com) using the [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library and Mike Bostock's [Zoomable Circle Packing](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-circle-packing). I learnt D3 while doing this project, so the code is definitely neither nice nor optimized (and not commented). In addition, there are many features that I would like to add but haven't quite found the time to do so. Hopefully, I will be able to clean up the code and finish the project sometime in the future.
