We developed a new alignment technique to study the structure of biological systems. Given any pair of networks, our method maps their structures on top of each other by pairing similar nodes. As a result, we can identify analogous nodes across networks&#8212;i.e., nodes that play analogous roles. In this work, I use this alignment technique to understand dynamics and structure of ecological networks.
