Recent advances in network science have provided multiple methods for aligning complex networks. Most of these methods, however, focus on aligning undirected networks, making them ill-suited for ecological networks like predator-prey food webs in which the direction of interactions is particularly relevant. We developed a new alignment technique specifically designed for directed networks. Given a pair of aligned networks, our method provides us with two key pieces of information. The first is a metric describing the ``quality'' of the alignment between networks, which represents an overall measure of how similar two networks are to each other. The second consists of a list of the corresponding species-species pairings between those food webs, specifying the actual mapping of the alignment between them. In my work, I use this alignment technique to understand dynamics and structure of ecological networks.
