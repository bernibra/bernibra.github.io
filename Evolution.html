		Although the concept of evolution was widely accepted by the end of the nineteenth century, the idea of using phylogenetic trees to compare phenotypes across different species has been around for just over 30 years. It was mainly introduced by Felsenstein (1985) and Cheverud et al. (1985), who pointed out that species with common ancestors cannot be considered independent when studying their phenotypic variation. They presented the first phylogenetic comparative methods to study evolution, setting the basis for what is today a crucial tool for the study of evolutionary biology. To date, however, it has not been fully explored the use of phylogenetic comparative methods to analyse the structure of ecological communities. Following this, in my work, I argue for the use of methods in phylogenetic comparative analysis to study species' interactions as phenotypic traits.
