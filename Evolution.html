            <p class="petit"> Null models have become a crucial tool for understanding structure within incidence matrices across multiple biological contexts. For example, they have been widely used for the study of ecological and biogeographic questions, testing hypotheses regarding patterns of community assembly, species co-occurrence, and biodiversity. In this work we combine the classic concept of a null model and the ideas underlying joint modeling in community ecology, which are a set of statistical tools for integrating environmental predictors and species interactions into a common framework. In particular, we develop correlation-informed null models that flexibly incorporate biologically relevant information as an ingredient for the null hypotheses to test of the influence of such factors on the structure of biological data. </p>
