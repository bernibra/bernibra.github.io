      <p class = "petit">A workshop that I co-organized with <a href="https://www.cagua.co/">Fernando Cagua</a> on how to use data-science to empower management and conservation. In this worshop, we taught how to create electronic surveys and interactive real-time dashboards to ecologists. The workshop has been presented several times, including at the EcoTAS 2017 conference and at ETHZ.<br>

      <h2 class = "gran">Scientific publications</h2>
      <p class = "petit">Throughout my scientific career, I developed visualizations that have been published as part of several scientific articles, all of which were generated programatically using different software libraries. Examples of these include: <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/bernibra.github.io/blob/development/example-visualizations/NatComm2018-supplmenetary.pdf"  target="_blank">network visualizations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/bernibra.github.io/blob/development/example-visualizations/NatComm2021-manuscript.pdf"  target="_blank">representations of the output of Bayesian models</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/bernibra.github.io/blob/development/example-visualizations/AmNat2023-supplementary.pdf"  target="_blank">geographical representations</a>.</p>

      <h2 class = "gran">This website</h2>
      <p class = "petit">Using D3.js, a JavaScript library for producing dynamic visualizations, I developed this website. Notice that, as opposed to regular websites, this simply displays an svg object that the user can interact with. The code is publicly available. That said, this was developed when I was starting my Ph.D. and as a way to learn D3.js; therefore, the code is messy and poorly documented (pending a clean-up).<br>

      <h2 class = "gran">Single-cell data analysis</h2>
      <p class = "petit">This is one of the many examples of my use of R Shiny or Python Dash to create interactive web applications. In this particular case, I developed <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/tagtango"  target="_blank">tagtango</a>, a powerful web application designed for the comprehensive analysis and comparison of multiple cell annotations or clusterings. Examples of the use of this application were published at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf012"  target="_blank"><i>Bioinformatics</i></a>.<br>
