        <p class = "petit">A workshop that I co-organized with <a href="https://www.cagua.co/">Fernando Cagua</a> on how to use data-science to empower management and conservation. In this worshop, we taught how to create electronic surveys and interactive real-time dashboards to ecologists. The workshop has been presented several times, including at the EcoTAS 2017 conference and at ETHZ.<br>

        <p class = "petit">Throughout my scientific career, I developed visualizations that have been published as part of several scientific articles, all of which were generated programatically using different software libraries. Examples of these include: <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/bernibra.github.io/blob/development/example-visualizations/NatComm2018-supplmenetary.pdf"  target="_blank">network visualizations</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/bernibra.github.io/blob/development/example-visualizations/NatComm2021-manuscript.pdf"  target="_blank">representations of the output of Bayesian models</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/bernibra.github.io/blob/development/example-visualizations/AmNat2023-supplementary.pdf"  target="_blank">geographical representations</a>.</p>

        <p class = "petit">In my teaching roles, I have given numerous workshops and lectures on diverse topics, from statistics to ecology. Examples include: a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wwcT0nv2idmHqmHoIGks62GI1YD8Gfnn/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">workshop on developing statistical models for longitudinal data</a>, a presentation on <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1smYmGep1df2RN9kL4s-iO2Xma86I2D1Y/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">developing non-linear Bayesian models</a>, or innovative practical sessions using Jupyter notebooks for ETHZ courses during the pandemic (<a href="https://github.com/bernibra/Quantitative-Approaches-practical" target="_blank">Practical 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/Quantitative-Approaches-practical2" target="_blank">Practical 2</a>).</p>

        <h2 class = "gran">Single-cell data analysis</h2>
        <p class = "petit">This is one of the many examples of my use of R Shiny or Python Dash to create interactive web applications. In this particular case, I developed <a href="https://github.com/bernibra/tagtango"  target="_blank">tagtango</a>, a powerful web application designed for the comprehensive analysis and comparison of multiple cell annotations or clusterings. Examples of the use of this application were published at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf012"  target="_blank"><i>Bioinformatics</i></a>.<br>
