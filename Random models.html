Null models have become a crucial tool for understanding structure within incidence matrices across multiple biological contexts. In this work, we combine the classic concept of a null model and the ideas underlying joint modeling in community ecology. In particular, we develop correlation-informed null models that flexibly incorporate biologically relevant information as an ingredient for the null hypotheses to test the influence of such factors on the structure of biological data.
