1) Replace "Projects" by "skills"

- Bayesian and Frequentist Statistics
  + Plant Stan: stan, mvrstan, brms
  + multinomial regression Nat Comm
- Data Visualization:
  + Some of the most beautiful visualizations of my work as a scientist (add code to it)
  + d3 is my website
- Dashboards:
  + workshop website in gitlab
  + CITE-wrangling shinyapps
  + MIREN data
- ML approaches
  + Muritz
  + pymfinder
  + CITE-wrangling
  + multicenter

2) Add links to Resume and change structure

I should add links for all the thinks I am mention, the BDSC, the ETHZ, the Universities, the code and websites for workshops. I should also add a selected software section.

3) Modify colours and remove titles for Resume and Conferences
